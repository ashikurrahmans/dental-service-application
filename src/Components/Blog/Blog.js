                  Authentication is the process of verifying the right person
                  who is already been authenticated or not. whereas
                  authorization is the process of verifying what specific
                  applications, files, and data a user has access to. The
                  situation is like that of an airline that needs to determine
                  which people can come on board.authentication and
                  authorization accomplish these same goals. Authentication is
                  used to verify that users really are who they represent
                  themselves to be.

                  Firebase is originally developed by Firebase inc and later
                  acquired by Google. It provides different kinds of services
                  that help us to develop high-quality mobile and web
                  applications to grow our businesses. Google Firebase offers
                  many features that pitch it as the go-to backend development
                  tool for web and mobile apps. It reduces development workload
                  and time. And it's a perfect prototyping tool. Firebase is
                  simple, lightweight, friendly, and industrially recognized.
