                  A1. The most fundamental yet crucial difference between JS and
                  Node JS is that JavaScript is a programming language that is
                  used to write scripts, whereas Node JS is a JavaScript runtime
                  environment that is used to develop applications. Node JS is
                  used to establish a runtime environment that allows JavaScript
                  code to be executed in a production environment (system where
                  codes are built) as well as in the application (browser or any
                  other application) where it is meant to be executed.
                  Javascript is a programming language that can only be used in
                  browsers, however we can execute Javascript outside of the
                  browser with the help of NodeJS.

                  Firebase is originally developed by Firebase inc and later
                  acquired by Google. It provides different kinds of services
                  that help us to develop high-quality mobile and web
                  applications to grow our businesses. Google Firebase offers
                  many features that pitch it as the go-to backend development
                  tool for web and mobile apps. It reduces development workload
                  and time. And it's a perfect prototyping tool. Firebase is
                  simple, lightweight, friendly, and industrially recognized.
